            <p class="text-lg text-slate-600">Managing personal finances is more than just counting pennies; it is about building a foundation for your future. At CalcForge, we provide the tools, but this guide provides the strategy.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10">1. Understanding the Power of Compound Interest</h2>
            <p>Compound interest is often called the eighth wonder of the world. It is the interest you earn on interest. When you use our <strong>SIP Calculator</strong>, you see this in action. By investing small amounts consistently, your wealth grows exponentially over 10, 20, or 30 years.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10">2. Mastering the Debt-to-Income Ratio</h2>
            <p>Before taking a loan, you must understand your limits. Banks use the 28/36 rule. No more than 28% of your gross income should go to housing, and no more than 36% to total debt. Use our <strong>Loan EMI Tool</strong> to see if your monthly payments fit within these healthy boundaries.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10">3. The Importance of an Emergency Fund</h2>
            <p>Financial experts recommend having 3 to 6 months of living expenses saved in a high-yield account. This prevents you from taking high-interest loans when unexpected car repairs or medical bills arise.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10">4. Tracking Your Health as an Asset</h2>
            <p>Wealth is nothing without health. Maintaining a healthy BMI (Body Mass Index) reduces long-term medical costs and increases your productivity and lifespan. Our <strong>BMI Analyzer</strong> helps you keep this vital metric in check.</p>
